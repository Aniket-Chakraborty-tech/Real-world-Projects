⚙️ How to Run
------------
To run the projects, follow these steps:
1. **Setup**: Clone the repository using Git or download the ZIP file.
2. **Environment**: Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
3. **Build**: Compile the Java files using the `javac` command or an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ.
4. **Deploy**: Run the compiled Java files using the `java` command or an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ.

For example, to run the `Clock.java` file, navigate to the `src` folder and compile the file using the following command:
```bash
javac Clock.java
```
Then, run the compiled file using the following command:
```bash
java Clock
```
🧪 Testing Instructions
----------------------
To test the projects, follow these steps:
1. **Unit Tests**: Run the unit tests using the `JUnit` framework or an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ.
2. **Integration Tests**: Run the integration tests using the `JUnit` framework or an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ.
3. **Manual Testing**: Test the projects manually by running the Java files and verifying the output.

For example, to run the unit tests for the `ContactManagement.java` file, navigate to the `tests` folder and run the following command:
```bash
javac ContactManagementTest.java
```
Then, run the compiled test file using the following command:
```bash
java ContactManagementTest
```
